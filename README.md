## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) - Database

### What I learned

After a couple of months of playing with React, this is my first project using it. I picked this challenge because I think this is a very good project to familiarize myself with the basics and react hooks. I save todos in Firebase real-time database because I just want to see how the backend/RestAPI work. And for styling, I use styled-components because I'm not a fan of CSS-in-JS or CSS modules. I didn't add the drag and drop feature for now because I can't find a way to reorder data from the server without deleting the entire set of data and re-uploading the updated set of data. If someday I find a solution to this, I'll add it to this project.
